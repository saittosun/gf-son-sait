      so as the user to understand which amount of the additional company fee is included in the total price of the
      service provided by the Third Party.</p>

      exchange rate.</p>
    <p>The company is not obliged to deliver the tickets to the user, before the successful completion of the payment
      procedure. The company will book the ferry ticket or any other service only if there is a successful completion of
      the payment. In case that the reservation due to technical failure is unavailable despite the fulfillment of the
      payment, the company undertakes the responsibility to immediately withdraw (within the day) the transaction and
      return the full amount in Euros. The refund of the amount from the customer's bank is usually carried out within

      confirmation email and notify our company immediately, for any discrepancies or errors that may be included. </p>

    <p>Your ferry tickets for trips in Greece or abroad, after the payment of the relevant reservation, can be sent to
      you by courier with an additional cost clearly described and outlined before the payment procedure. The cost of
      courier services varies depending on the date and place of the delivery. Irrespectively of the aforementioned
      possibility, you can receive your tickets from our company in the address mentioned in the beginning of these
      Terms of Use or from any authorized agencies of the relevant Third Provider (e.g. from the port of departure where
      the agency of the relevant shipping company is located).</p>
    <h3>Regarding any modification or cancellation of the ticket</h3>
    <p>The possibility to change or cancel a ferry ticket, a trip or another product or service are matters regulated by
      the terms of use of each Third Provider (e.g. by the relevant ferry company). For this reason, we recommend you
      read and comply with them, as it is necessary for the provision of the travel services. Our company, acting as
      facilitator, is not able to influence the terms of use of the Third Providers and that is why our company is not
      liable for issues regulated by them. For example, the terms of use of the Third Providers may define the costs
      that burden to modify or cancel the relevant travel service, which you have already selected. In case the Third
      Party provides you with the right to change or cancel the selected travel service (e.g. modification or
      cancellation of the relevant ticket reservation), you must notify us, via the contact form or through the page "
      My Reservation” no later than 48 hours before the scheduled departure, in order to make the desired change or
      cancellation in accordance with the terms of the relevant Third Provider. In case of a late notification a
      modification or cancellation of the reservation is not possible.</p>
    <p>You are charged with a fee of six Euros (6 €) for the actions required by the company to cancel or change your
      purchased service. Furthermore, the modification or cancellation of the ticket takes place in accordance with the
      charges of the respective Third Provider (e.g. the respective shipping company), which are defined in its relevant
      terms of use. In general, the amount of the cost for the modification or the cancelation of the travel service,
      which is charged by each Third Provider, is determined by different factors, such as the time of the cancellation.
      These factors are described in the respective terms of use of the relevant Third Provider, with which you must
      comply. In case of cancellation, the remaining amount from the total cost you paid for the selected travel
      service, since it would be reduced after the aforementioned charges, will be refunded. In case that the Third
      Provider is responsible for the cancelation, you will not be burdened with any charge.</p>
